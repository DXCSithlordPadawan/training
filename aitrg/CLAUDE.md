# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **AI Training Documentation (AITRG)** project - a comprehensive training package for Artificial Intelligence tools including Claude Code, M365 Copilot, and best practices for AI usage. The project creates a full-time self-study syllabus (37.5 hours/week) with educational resources, assessments, and lesson plans.

## Project Purpose

Create enterprise-grade AI training documentation that:
- Teaches effective use of Claude Code (prompts, skills, agents, sub-tasks)
- Covers M365 Copilot usage
- Defines guardrails and prevents AI hallucination
- Complies with UK Gov Secure by Design and NCSC Secure Design Principles for AI
- Uses only free, no-registration-required resources

## Required Deliverables

The project must produce these specific markdown files:

1. **syllabus.md** - Detailed subject list with hyperlinks to resources and timing estimates
2. **resources.md** - Curated list of all training resources with URLs
3. **selfassessment.md** - Self-assessment questionnaire for post-training evaluation
4. **quiz.md** - Knowledge test with answers
5. **lesson.md** - Detailed lesson plans for each subject
6. **README.md** - Table of contents, usage instructions, embedded Mermaid diagrams, YAML examples
7. **aitrg_Overview.md** - Executive summary

## Key Constraints

- **All resources must be free and require no registration/payment**
- Preferred sources include:
  - https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai
  - Net Ninja, Network Chuck, TechWorld with Nana YouTube channels
  - Verified free resources only
- All documentation in Markdown format
- Diagrams must use Mermaid syntax
- Configuration examples in YAML
- Final deliverable: ZIP bundle of all files

## Compliance Requirements

All content must align with:
- UK Government "Secure by Design for AI" guidelines
- NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) Secure Design Principles for AI

## Working Directory

All files are created in: `/media/odin/m2ssd/phoenix/aitrg`

## Content Development Guidelines

When creating or updating training content:

1. **Resource Verification**: Ensure all linked resources are freely accessible without registration or payment
2. **Timing Accuracy**: Training content should align with a 37.5-hour/week self-study schedule
3. **Practical Focus**: Emphasize hands-on Claude Code usage (prompt engineering, skill creation, agent orchestration)
4. **Security First**: Integrate UK Gov and NCSC AI security principles throughout content
5. **Assessment Alignment**: Ensure quiz and self-assessment questions directly test syllabus content
6. **Diagram Integration**: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize AI workflows, agent interactions, and architectural concepts

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear, consistent markdown formatting
- Include clickable table of contents in README.md
- Embed Mermaid diagrams directly in markdown files
- Provide working YAML configuration examples
- Cross-reference between documents using relative links
- Maintain professional tone suitable for enterprise training
