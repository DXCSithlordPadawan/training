### Lesson Activities

#### Activity 1: Secure by Design Principles (90 minutes)
1. Read complete UK Gov Secure by Design guidance (60 minutes)
2. Document key principles (30 minutes):

**Core Principles**:
1. **Secure by Default**: Security enabled from the start
2. **Privacy by Design**: Data protection built-in
3. **Transparency**: Clear about AI usage and limitations
4. **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility
5. **Fairness**: Avoid bias and discrimination
6. **Robustness**: Reliable and resilient systems
7. **Human Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop controls

For each principle, document:
- What it means
- Why it matters for PRD work
- How to implement it
- Examples of compliance

#### Activity 2: Security Risk Assessment for AI-Assisted PRDs (90 minutes)
1. Identify security risks (45 minutes):

**Data Security Risks**:
- Confidential information in prompts
- Sensitive requirements shared with AI
- Intellectual property exposure
- Competitive information disclosure

**Quality Risks**:
- Hallucinated requirements
- Inaccurate technical specifications
- Misleading analysis or recommendations
- Incomplete security requirements

**Compliance Risks**:
- Non-compliant security controls
- Inadequate privacy measures
- Regulatory requirement gaps
- Industry standard violations

2. Create risk matrix (45 minutes):
   - List each risk
   - Rate likelihood (Low/Medium/High)
   - Rate impact (Low/Medium/High)
   - Identify mitigations
   - Assign responsibility

#### Activity 3: Secure Workflow Design (75 minutes)
1. Design secure AI usage workflow (45 minutes):

```
SECURE AI-ASSISTED PRD WORKFLOW

PHASE 1: PREPARATION
☐ Classify information sensitivity
☐ Identify confidential elements
☐ Create sanitized versions for AI use
☐ Document AI usage approval

PHASE 2: AI INTERACTION
☐ Use only non-confidential information in prompts
☐ Avoid specific customer/product names
☐ Use generic examples
☐ Save all prompts and responses
☐ Document AI tool version and date

PHASE 3: VALIDATION
☐ Human review all AI outputs
☐ Verify accuracy against sources
☐ Check for hallucinations
☐ Validate security requirements
☐ Confirm compliance requirements

PHASE 4: FINALIZATION
☐ Add confidential details manually
☐ Apply security classifications
☐ Document AI contribution percentage
☐ Archive prompts and validation records
☐ Get stakeholder approval

PHASE 5: AUDIT TRAIL
☐ Maintain prompt library
☐ Document validation outcomes
☐ Record issues encountered
☐ Track quality metrics
☐ Review and improve process
```

2. Create data classification scheme (30 minutes):
   - Public information (OK for AI)
   - Internal information (use with caution)
   - Confidential information (never use in prompts)
   - Examples of each category

#### Activity 4: Security Requirements Meta-Prompt (45 minutes)
Create security-focused meta-prompt:

```
META-PROMPT: SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

When generating or reviewing security requirements, ensure compliance with:

AUTHENTICATION:
☐ Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
☐ Strong password requirements
☐ Account lockout after failed attempts
☐ Session management and timeout
☐ Secure credential storage

AUTHORIZATION:
☐ Role-based access control
☐ Principle of least privilege
☐ Separation of duties
☐ Access logging and monitoring
☐ Regular access reviews

DATA PROTECTION:
☐ Encryption at rest and in transit
☐ Data classification and handling
☐ Secure data disposal
☐ Backup and recovery
☐ Privacy controls (GDPR compliance)

AUDIT AND MONITORING:
☐ Comprehensive audit logging
☐ Security event monitoring
☐ Anomaly detection
☐ Incident response procedures
☐ Regular security reviews

SECURE DEVELOPMENT:
☐ Input validation
☐ Output encoding
☐ Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
☐ Secure API design
☐ Security testing requirements

For each security requirement:
- Be specific and measurable
- Reference security standards
- Include validation criteria
- Consider threat scenarios
```
